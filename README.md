# Project_3

## This project allows a user to communicate with a smart contract through AWS Lex. I wrote a Solidity program with several classes to simulate a bank account. We deployed this smart contract on the Kovan Ethereum test network. We created an instance of AWS Lex with multiple intents and connected Lex with AWS Lambda. I wrote the Lambda code in Node.js, and this code allows the user to transmit their queries from Lex to the Kovan ETH test network. The answer to the user's query will be relayed back to Lex.
